<p>Iâ€™m a software engineer, product builder and entrepreneur. I also love spending time with my family, traveling and reading.</p>

<p>At the moment Iâ€™m working on a marketing and communication product that will help companies improve their efficiency and profitability.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a passionate JVM fan (Java/Scala) and have good programming foundation with focus on backend stuff, so primarily data crunching as well as api endpoints using Java and Spring. I enjoy collaborating with others to solve problems, to overcome obstacles and to achieve success.</p>

<p>Other things that I have great interests in is networking, transport protocols, asynchronous I/O, threading, distributed and decentralised systems.</p>
